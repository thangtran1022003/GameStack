A Dead Simple clone of STACK game by Ketchapp built with [`React`](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [`Three.js`](https://threejs.org/) and [`cannon.js`](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js)

## Description

In Stack, the blocks continue to move in and you just click to place them on your pile, but you must be careful. 

If the block hangs over the edge of the stack, a piece will break off. This will make subsequent blocks smaller and more difficult to place. 

You receive a point for each block you stack.
